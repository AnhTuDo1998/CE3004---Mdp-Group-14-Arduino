# CE3004---Mdp-Group-14-Arduino
A repo for hardware development of MDP group 14 project AY1920 S1. This documents are free for use by juniors to aid them in MDP process. Included below are hardware information, software library used, some control theory and tips and tricks on acing MDP.

1. Hardware Components:
Rough BOM for MDP (as provided by the school):

2. Software Library:
The following library are used in this project source code:
- DualVNH5019MotorShield.h : 
		This library is provided by the manufacturer of the motor shield controlling the motors. Users can give an int from -400 to 400 as PWM input for the motor turning. There are also functions to brake the motor. More details at this <a href ="https://github.com/pololu/dual-vnh5019-motor-shield">link</a>
