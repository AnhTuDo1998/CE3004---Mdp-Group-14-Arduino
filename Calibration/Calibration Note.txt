Note on calibrating Motor:

1. After collect the data samples for different motor speead, an average value is taken to ensure 
accuracy and precision of reading.

2. Plotting data on excel spreadsheet and using the trendline function to determine the equation to convert
rpm to motor speed (0-400) and vice versa.

3. It is noted that there is a linear operation range where the speed vs rpm relationship is not distorted 
(from speed 50 to speed 350). We can omit data outside this range and do further omission to obtain a good linear
equation

4. Using the r^2 value as a guideline to obtain a nice linear equation for conversion
